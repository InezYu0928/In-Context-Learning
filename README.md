# On the Robustness of In-Context Learning with \\Noisy Labels: Train, Inference, and Beyond

This is the repository for our paper **On the Robustness of In-Context Learning with \\Noisy Labels: Train, Inference, and Beyond**, 

with Cheng Chen, Haodong Wen, Xinzhi Yu, Zeming Wei.

Paper link: TBD

## Train transformers with noisy labels (Section 4)


## In-context inference with noisy labels (Section 5)

[model checkpoints](https://github.com/dtsip/in-context-learning/releases/download/initial/models.zip) and extract them in the current directory.


## Noisy inference with Noisy training (Section 6)

## Extrapolating beyond *i.i.d.* noises (Section 7)
